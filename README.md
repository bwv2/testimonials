- [Kevin Thomas](https://github.com/trustedmercury) - I think this repository is more for wulf's experience in the development world but that's not always the only aspect that one should be looking for in a great developer. While he's one of the best young developers I've met, with his extremely clean and efficient code, his rapid speed to learn and understand new concepts leaves me dumbfounded. Over the last few months, I've had the enlightening opportunity to get to know him better and I can say with absolute certainty that he's capable to do any task that he sets his sight on. Although he's really young, he's still extremely capable (for and beyond his age) and one of the most mature people I know.
